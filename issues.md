As a senior developer please review the code base to find and fix the following issues

- [ ] The cards on the dashboard must be collapsable
- [ ] Remove the Tasks navigation items (its not required)
- [ ] Search for tasks within the user view not filtering as user types

- [ ] How can we record when an asset has been serviced? A task should have at least one asset.
- [ ] Spatie media library will be used to manage media files
- [ ] Add asset brand and asset model tables so that the user will have options to select from; create a seeder with common AC brands and models
- [ ] Remove the HasEmail badge from customers; that makes no sense to me there
- [ ] Allow the elements on the customer card to be clickable
    - [ ] Phone number will be able to call
    - [ ] Email to send email
    - [ ] Customer name to view entire customer profile
    - [ ] Sites to view customer profile with site not collapsed and task history collapsed
    - [ ] When assets are clicked, go to assets
- [ ] The dropdown image within the select inputs are off
- [ ] Items in the calendar view are not able to be clicked to view
- [ ] Click on a date in the calendar to add a task and allow the form to already have the date that is clicked loaded
- [ ] Clean up the stuff that came with the starter kit repository and documentation link and update the project name
